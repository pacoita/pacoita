### Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹

With a past in DB Migrations and webforms, one day I fell in love with web development :heart:

I like to test bleeding edge web APIs :rocket: and create PWAs :no_mobile_phones: and sometimes I even write about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paco_ITA) or on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/paco_ita)
