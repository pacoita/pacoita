## 🙋‍♂️ Who am I
I am currently based in Switzerland, working as Principal Software Engineer and Angular Trainer.

Even though I work as a full stack engineer, having .NET and C# as my backend side, I am a big fan of web technologies, especially Angular, Svelte, PWAs and modern web in general.
I love to constantly experiment with them in side projects and share my findings at conferences or writing tech articles.
